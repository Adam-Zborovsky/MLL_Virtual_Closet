I had an idea for a virtual closet app for couples
where you have a screen showing all the shirts and pants you own
and when one is clicked it shows you all the other clothes that match that piece
the matching clothes are decided by the second user (significant other)

I created it by learning it all by myself
and I want to get better at Android development
can someone review my code and give me some feedback pls
I suggest running it first so you get a sense of the idea
